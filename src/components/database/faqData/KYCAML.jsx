        The crypto market is subject to a number of certain rules and

        AML/KYC procedure implemented.

        ChangeNOW strives to protect our clients from any type of scams and
        fraudulent activities in the crypto world and complies to all rules and
        regulations present at the moment, and one of the ways that enables us
        to do so is the KYC/AML procedure.
      </div>
      <div className="text-xl text-blue">
        This procedure confirms the absolute legality of the transaction carried
        out by you before the regulatory institutions. Thus, you confirm that
        you are a law-abiding citizen and the state has no reason to address any
        claims towards you.

        {"ChangeNOW's"} AML/KYC procedure is supported by an automated risk
        prevention system. If a transaction is marked suspicious by this system,
        the exchange is put on hold and the customer in question is then asked
        to confirm their identity.
      </div>
      <div className="text-xl text-blue">
        There is a certain set of criteria that the system employs; however,
        they {"can't"} be made public, otherwise there will be people who will
        try to abuse those criteria in order to cheat the algorithm.
      </div>
      <div className="text-xl text-blue">
        This system has proven to be very useful against money launderers and
        scammers, since the KYC process allows us to tell an honest customer
        apart from a scammer very quickly and without any trouble.
      </div>
      <div className="text-xl text-blue">
        Each KYC case is handled individually. If a certain client is eligible
        for the procedure since their transaction had been marked as suspicious,
        they will have a special status update on the exchange page along with a
        Verify button; the button will lead to our KYC provider {"SumSub's"}
        verification tool.
      </div>
      <div className="text-xl text-blue">
        Swapmute is partnered with a KYC provider called SumSub. In order to get
        your identity verified, you will be offered to follow {"SumSub's"} link
        (it will be under the Verify button) and complete the verification
        through a comfortable and smooth UI. You will have 3 days to complete
        the verification procedure, and if you {"don't"} want to pass KYC, you
        can refuse (in that case, please shoot a message to
        support@swapmute.com) and receive a refund.

        During the process, the police or Law Enforcement must provide us with a

        ticket.

      <div>
        Kindly note that we will be able to return frozen funds only per request

        question.
      </div>
      <div>
        Please note that the transaction might be stopped after the trading
        stage, depending on the time the report about stolen funds was received.
        In such cases, we will be able to return the funds in the asset to which
        the exchange was made (to-currency).
